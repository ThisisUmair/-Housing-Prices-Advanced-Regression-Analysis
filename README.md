## üè† Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Analysis  

This project explores the **Ames Housing Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview) to predict house sale prices using **XGBoost Regression**. The dataset includes 79 variables describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa, with the goal of predicting the final **Sale Price** for unseen test data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using `XGBRegressor` with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`. Key hyperparameters such as `n_estimators` (100‚Äì500), `learning_rate` (0.03‚Äì0.3), and `objective` ('reg:squarederror') were optimized to minimize **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. The model demonstrated strong predictive performance, showcasing the effectiveness of advanced regression methods for structured data. Technologies used include **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **scikit-learn**, and **XGBoost**.
